              Yogurt from Turkish: yoÄŸurt, also spelled yoghurt, yogourt or
              yoghourt is a food produced by bacterial fermentation of milk.The
              bacteria used to make yogurt are known as yogurt cultures.
              Fermentation of sugars in the milk by these bacteria produces
              lactic acid, which acts on milk protein to give yogurt its texture
              and characteristic tart flavor.[2] Cow's milk is the milk most
              commonly used to make yogurt.
